##Ch 10 
#1. What is a class?
1. A class is a definition of a user-defined type.A class declaration specifies how data is to be stored,and it specifies the methods (class member functions) that can be used to access and manipulate that data. 
#2. How does a class accomplish abstraction, encapsulation, and data hiding?
2. A class represents the operations you can perform on a class object with a public interface of class methods;this is abstraction.The class can use private visibility (the default) for data members,meaning that the data can be accessed only through the member functions;this is data hiding.Details of the implementation,such as data representation and method code,are hidden;this is encapsulation.
#3. What is the relationship between an object and a class?
 3. A class defines a type,including how it can be used.An object is a variable or another data object,such as that produced by new,which is created and used according to the class definition.The relationship between a class and an object is the same as that between a standard type and a variable of that type.
#4. In what way, aside from being functions, are class function members different from class data members?

4. If you create several objects of a given class,each object comes with storage for its own set of data.But all the objects use the one set of member functions.(Typically, methods are public and data members are private,but that’s a matter of policy,not of class requirements.)
#6. When are class constructors called? When are class destructors called?
6. A class constructor is called when you create an object of that class or when you explicitly call the constructor.A class destructor is called when the object expires.
 
8. A default constructor either has no arguments or has defaults for all the arguments. Having a default constructor enables you to declare objects without initializing them,even if you’ve already defined an initializing constructor.It also allows you to declare arrays.
 
10. The this pointer is available to class methods.It points to the object used to invoke the method.Thus,this is the address of the object,and *this represents the object itself
